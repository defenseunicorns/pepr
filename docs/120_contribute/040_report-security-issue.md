# Reporting Security Issues

Security issues should be reported privately, via [GitHub UI](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr/security/advisories/new), or via email to [pepr@defenseunicorns.com](mailto:pepr@defenseunicorns.com?subject=Vulnerability). We prefer that you do not post vulnerabilities in the public issue tracker to which could lead to disclosure of the vulnerability before a fix is available. For more info, read [Security Policy](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr/security/policy).
