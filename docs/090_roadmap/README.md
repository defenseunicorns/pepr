# Roadmap for Pepr 
_2024 Roadmap_  
## Phase 1: Preparation - Testing and Docs

- **Q1**:
  - **Establish Medium for Communication with Community**:
    - Establish communication channel for community members and contributors. Easy/discoverable "how to contribute" guide.
  - **Site/Documentation**:
    - Improve information architecture, nail killer use-cases, and make it obvious how to get started and find your way around.
  - **Automated Testing**:
    - Focus on stories that increase confidence in protection of features and functionality. Simplify hello-pepr and bring e2e test against external repo with examples. Make sure that contributions are well-tested.

## Phase 2: Community Building, Competitive Analysis, Instrumentation and Feature Development

- **Q2**:
  - **Community Engagement**:
    - Begin engaging with potential contributors and users through social media, Kubernetes/Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) meetups, and other channels. Monitor and participate in our Slack channel.
  - **Feature Development**:
    - Based on company feedback, continuously improve and add features. Add feature parity with other tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem where it makes sense. Chip away at the backlog.
  - **Documentation Improvements**:
    - Continue to improve documentation and add more examples like Doom, find scaling limitations
  - **Competitive Analysis**:
    - Understand the competitive landscape and how/where Pepr can/does differentiate itself. Have it in the docs.
  - **Instrumentation**:
    - Outfit Pepr with the necessary instrumentation to collect metrics and logs. Use this data to make informed about the watch direction.

## Phase 3: Informer Iterations, Watch Analysis, Metric Collection, Development/Stabilization/Improvement of New Features

- **Q3**:
  - **Informer Iterations**:
    - Tune informer based on feedback from UDS Core and delivery so events will be reconciled through eventual consistency.
    - [Evaluate](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr/blob/main/adr/0015-kfc-watch-undici.md) other underlying technologies for informer.
  - **Feature Development**:
    - `.WithNameRegex()/.InNamespaceRegex()` for Kubernetes Controller development against resources that could match a variety of names or namespaces.
    - `.WithDeletionTimestamp()` for Kubernetes Controller Development against resources that are pending deletion
    - Create a sharded queue that enables the Module Author to define queueing strategies based on `kind`, `kind/namespace`, `kind/namespace/name`, `global`.
  - **Community Building**:
    - Grow the contributor base, establish a governance model, and encourage community-led initiatives. Look to drive conversation in our Slack Channel.
    - Based on community feedback, continuously improve and add features. Rigoursly test and document and review code.
  - **Project Advocation**:
    - Publicly advocate for the project and encourage adoption.
  - **Stability**:
    - Ensure that the project is stable and reliable. Make sure that the project is well-tested and documented.
    - Identify new areas of project improvement and work on them.

## Phase 4: Feature Development, Stablization, Code and Testing Quality Improvements

- **Q4**:
  - **Features**:
    - Improve DevEx overrides in Pepr section of package.json for customized builds of Modules
    - `.Finalize()` for Kubernetes Controller Development to controlling downstream resources through finalizers
    - Scaffolding to validate images from a registry through cosign/sigstore
    - Replace node-fetch with Undici in the KFC project for performance improvements
  - **Removal of Circular Dependencies**:
    Identify and remove circular dependencies in the codebase.
  - **Strong Typings**:
    - Identify where we can make Pepr/KFC stronger by adding typings.
  - **Work to reduce code complexity**
    - Monitor code complexity through eslint, work to drive down complexity
  - **Robust E2E Tests in KFC**:
    - Create a strong e2e suite in KFC, ensure tests are robust and cover all the features of KFC.
  - **Documentation**:
    - Ensure that the documentation is up-to-date and accurate. Add more examples and use-cases.
    - Onboarding and contribution guides should be clear and easy to follow.
  - **Load/Stress Testing**:
    - Load test Pepr/KFC to identify bottlenecks and areas of improvement.
    - Ensure that Pepr/KFC can handle a large number of resources and events over a sustained period of time (nightly).

_2025 Roadmap_  
## Phase 1: Code Quality - Experimentation 

- **Q1**:
  - **Turn on eslint enforcement and configure settings and see no warnings**:
    - Eliminate circular dependencies, complexity, return statements, etc.
  - **Metric and Performance Baselining**:
    - Establish a baseline for performance and resource utilization metrics. Use this data to make informed decisions about the direction of the project in terms of Deno2
  - **OTEL Preparation**:
    - Come up with a plan to implement Open Telemetry. Specifically distributed tracing, metrics, logs and events. Use this data to make debugging easier from a UDS Core prespective. There will be documentation work on how to use an OTEL collector with a Pepr Module.
  - **Nightly Release**:
    - Establish a nightly release process. This will help us to catch bugs early and ensure that the project is always in a releasable state.

## Phase 2: Durable Storage for Metrics and Performance Tests / Transactional Pepr Store

- **Q2**:
  - **Professional Dashboard displaying metrics and performance tests originating from CI**:
  - **Determine if a Transactional PeprStore makes sense**:
    - Sus out details involved with having a transactional Pepr Store. What are the implications of this? What are the benefits? What are the drawbacks? What are the use-cases? What are the technologies that can be used to implement this?
  - **Experimentation with Deno2**:
    - Experiment with Deno2 through Dash Days and see if it can be used in the project. Look into the performance improvements and new features that Deno2 brings to the table. 


## Phase 3: TBD

- **Q3**:
  - **Deno2 Implementation**:
    - If determined to be advisable, move forward with migrating the project to Deno2 (starting with the kubernetes-fluent-client..?). This phase will focus on adapting the codebase, conducting extensive testing, and creating comprehensive documentation to ensure a seamless transition.
  - **Transactional PeprStore Implementation**:
    - Begin integrating transactional functionality into PeprStore. The implementation will emphasize robust testing and clear documentation to support fast and reliable data operations in a transactional manner.

## Phase 4: TDB

- **Q4**:
